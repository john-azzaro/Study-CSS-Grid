## Notes

1. create  (class="grid") and nested divs (class="section1", etc).
2. create styling for each section.
3. create ruleset for .grid and display as grid (i.e. display: grid;).

Now you can start defining columns and rows within the grid...

4. In .grid, add a declaration called "grid-template-columns:"

    - Inside "grid-template-columns" we can define how many columns we want inside the grid.
    - if you put in "1fr", which is 1 fraction, which means the entire width of this grid box is going to be 1 fraction.  So basically 1 column inside the grid.
       \\  
        >>  grid-template-columns: 1fr;
       //
    - the result of this would show:
        [ 1 ]
        [ 2 ]
        [ 3 ]
        [ 4 ]
        [ 5 ]

    - if you want to have two columns, you add in another fraction.
       \\
        >> grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
       //
    - the result of this would show:
        [ 1 ]  [ 2 ]
        [ 3 ]  [ 4 ]
        [ 5 ]

    - so when it comes to columns and rows.
    - in the case of a single columns, we have a single column and 2 "lines" to the left and right of the column.
      \\
        | [ 1 ] |
      //
    - in the case of a double column, we have two column and 3 lines, one on the far left, one in the middle between the columns, and one to the right.

    - you can use different forms of measurment here.  The fr's can be changed depending on your need. For example:
       \\
        >>  grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr;  -- the left column will maintain 200px.
        >>  grid-template-columns: 20% 1fr;    -- the left column will maintain 20%. 
        >>  grid-template-columns: auto 1fr;   -- the left coluomn will shrink to fit the content we have inside the column
